1,"Einstein’s former apartment in Switzerland’s capital city, now turned into a mini museum. Offers a glimpse into the rich life of the world’s E=mc2 genius. Watch out for his school grades, which demonstrate that you don’t have to be the best in school to be a genius.",4 months ago
2,"The tourist guide recommended not to go in, because there is only some furniture and not much information. Of course it's cool to see the place where Einstein lived a hundred years ago, but paying to go in doesn't make any sense.",5 days ago

4,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. There is nothing interesting to do or see. Also got kicked out from the video viewing about the history of Einstein because a group had booked the viewing room.",1 week ago

9,"Although the Einstein Cafe extends through the block so there are entrances on two parallel streets, you can only access the narrow stairway going up to the museum from Kramgasse. The approximately 10 minutes video is very good, it details his whole life.",3 months ago
10,"It’s just a nice way to remember the great scientist and also his struggles and achievements in the face of WW1 and 2.",1 week ago

16,"It's an okay place, Einstein has just lived there for a couple of years. I am not sure if the things there actually belong to him or his family but if you are a history buff then it's a good one-time visit.",10 months ago
17,"It's a very steep walk up the stairs. When you reach the 1st floor then you have to purchase the ticket. It's all Einstein's information written on the wall regarding himself and his family. There's some of the family clothing, work items, etc.",1 year ago
